<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently
collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many
different sources to a centralized data store.</p>
<p>The use of Apache Flume is not only restricted to log data aggregation.
Since data sources are customizable, Flume can be used to transport massive quantities
of event data including but not limited to network traffic data, social-media-generated data,
email messages and pretty much any data source possible.</p>
<p>Apache Flume is a top level project at the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
<p>There are currently two release code lines available, versions 0.9.x and 1.x.</p>
<p>Documentation for the 0.9.x track is available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh/3/flume/UserGuide/">the Flume 0.9.x User Guide</a>.</p>
<p>This documentation applies to the 1.4.x track.</p>
<p>New and existing users are encouraged to use the 1.x releases so as to
leverage the performance improvements and configuration flexibilities available
in the latest architecture.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-flow-model">
<h4>Data flow model<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#data-flow-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A Flume event is defined as a unit of data flow having a byte payload and an
optional set of string attributes. A Flume agent is a (JVM) process that hosts
the components through which events flow from an external source to the next
destination (hop).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Agent component diagram" src="./01.Flume 1.6.0 User Guide_files/UserGuide_image00.png">
</div>
<p>A Flume source consumes events delivered to it by an external source like a web
server. The external source sends events to Flume in a format that is
recognized by the target Flume source. For example, an Avro Flume source can be
used to receive Avro events from Avro clients or other Flume agents in the flow
that send events from an Avro sink. A similar flow can be defined using
a Thrift Flume Source to receive events from a Thrift Sink or a Flume
Thrift Rpc Client or Thrift clients written in any language generated from
the Flume thrift protocol.When a Flume source receives an event, it
stores it into one or more channels. The channel is a passive store that keeps
the event until it’s consumed by a Flume sink. The file channel is one example
– it is backed by the local filesystem. The sink removes the event
from the channel and puts it into an external repository like HDFS (via Flume
HDFS sink) or forwards it to the Flume source of the next Flume agent (next
hop) in the flow. The source and sink within the given agent run asynchronously
with the events staged in the channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complex-flows">
<h4>Complex flows<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#complex-flows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Flume allows a user to build multi-hop flows where events travel through
multiple agents before reaching the final destination. It also allows fan-in
and fan-out flows, contextual routing and backup routes (fail-over) for failed
hops.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reliability">
<h4>Reliability<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#reliability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The events are staged in a channel on each agent. The events are then delivered
to the next agent or terminal repository (like HDFS) in the flow. The events
are removed from a channel only after they are stored in the channel of next
agent or in the terminal repository. This is a how the single-hop message
delivery semantics in Flume provide end-to-end reliability of the flow.</p>
<p>Flume uses a transactional approach to guarantee the reliable delivery of the
events. The sources and sinks encapsulate in a transaction the
storage/retrieval, respectively, of the events placed in or provided by a
transaction provided by the channel.  This ensures that the set of events are
reliably passed from point to point in the flow. In the case of a multi-hop
flow, the sink from the previous hop and the source from the next hop both have
their transactions running to ensure that the data is safely stored in the
channel of the next hop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recoverability">
<h4>Recoverability<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#recoverability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The events are staged in the channel, which manages recovery from failure.
Flume supports a durable file channel which is backed by the local file system.
There’s also a memory channel which simply stores the events in an in-memory
queue, which is faster but any events still left in the memory channel when an
agent process dies can’t be recovered.</p>

<h3>Setting up an agent<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#setting-up-an-agent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flume agent configuration is stored in a local configuration file.  This is a
text file that follows the Java properties file format.
Configurations for one or more agents can be specified in the same
configuration file. The configuration file includes properties of each source,
sink and channel in an agent and how they are wired together to form data
flows.</p>
<div class="section" id="configuring-individual-components">
<h4>Configuring individual components<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#configuring-individual-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each component (source, sink or channel) in the flow has a name, type, and set
of properties that are specific to the type and instantiation. For example, an
Avro source needs a hostname (or IP address) and a port number to receive data
from. A memory channel can have max queue size (“capacity”), and an HDFS sink
needs to know the file system URI, path to create files, frequency of file
rotation (“hdfs.rollInterval”) etc. All such attributes of a component needs to
be set in the properties file of the hosting Flume agent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wiring-the-pieces-together">
<h4>Wiring the pieces together<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#wiring-the-pieces-together" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The agent needs to know what individual components to load and how they are
connected in order to constitute the flow. This is done by listing the names of
each of the sources, sinks and channels in the agent, and then specifying the
connecting channel for each sink and source. For example, an agent flows events
from an Avro source called avroWeb to HDFS sink hdfs-cluster1 via a file
channel called file-channel. The configuration file will contain names of these
components and file-channel as a shared channel for both avroWeb source and
hdfs-cluster1 sink.</p>

<div class="section" id="starting-an-agent">
<h4>Starting an agent<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#starting-an-agent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An agent is started using a shell script called flume-ng which is located in
the bin directory of the Flume distribution. You need to specify the agent
name, the config directory, and the config file on the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ bin/flume-ng agent -n $agent_name -c conf -f conf/flume-conf.properties.template
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now the agent will start running source and sinks configured in the given
properties file.</p>

<h4>A simple example<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#a-simple-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here, we give an example configuration file, describing a single-node Flume deployment.
This configuration lets a user generate events and subsequently logs them to the console.</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># example.conf: A single-node Flume configuration</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This configuration defines a single agent named a1. a1 has a source that listens for data on port 44444, a channel
that buffers event data in memory, and a sink that logs event data to the console. The configuration file names the
various components, then describes their types and configuration parameters. A given configuration file might define
several named agents; when a given Flume process is launched a flag is passed telling it which named agent to manifest.</p>
<p>Given this configuration file, we can start Flume as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ bin/flume-ng agent --conf conf --conf-file example.conf --name a1 -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that in a full deployment we would typically include one more option: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--conf=&lt;conf-dir&gt;</span></tt>.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;conf-dir&gt;</span></tt> directory would include a shell script <em>flume-env.sh</em> and potentially a log4j properties file.
In this example, we pass a Java option to force Flume to log to the console and we go without a custom environment script.</p>
<p>From a separate terminal, we can then telnet port 44444 and send Flume an event:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><pre>$ telnet localhost 44444
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
Hello world! &lt;ENTER&gt;
OK</pre>
</div>
<p>The original Flume terminal will output the event in a log message.</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="na">12/06/19 15</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s">32:19 INFO source.NetcatSource: Source starting</span>

<h4>Installing third-party plugins<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#installing-third-party-plugins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Flume has a fully plugin-based architecture. While Flume ships with many
out-of-the-box sources, channels, sinks, serializers, and the like, many
implementations exist which ship separately from Flume.</p>
<p>While it has always been possible to include custom Flume components by
adding their jars to the FLUME_CLASSPATH variable in the flume-env.sh file,
Flume now supports a special directory called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plugins.d</span></tt> which automatically
picks up plugins that are packaged in a specific format. This allows for easier
management of plugin packaging issues as well as simpler debugging and
troubleshooting of several classes of issues, especially library dependency
conflicts.</p>

<div class="section" id="consolidation">
<h3>Consolidation<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#consolidation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A very common scenario in log collection is a large number of log producing
clients sending data to a few consumer agents that are attached to the storage
subsystem. For example, logs collected from hundreds of web servers sent to a
dozen of agents that write to HDFS cluster.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A fan-in flow using Avro RPC to consolidate events in one place" src="./01.Flume 1.6.0 User Guide_files/UserGuide_image02.png">
</div>
<p>This can be achieved in Flume by configuring a number of first tier agents with
an avro sink, all pointing to an avro source of single agent (Again you could
use the thrift sources/sinks/clients in such a scenario). This source
on the second tier agent consolidates the received events into a single
channel which is consumed by a sink to its final destination.</p>

<h3>Multiplexing the flow<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#multiplexing-the-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flume supports multiplexing the event flow to one or more destinations. This is
achieved by defining a flow multiplexer that can replicate or selectively route
an event to one or more channels.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="A fan-out flow using a (multiplexing) channel selector" src="./01.Flume 1.6.0 User Guide_files/UserGuide_image01.png">
</div>
<p>The above example shows a source from agent “foo” fanning out the flow to three
different channels. This fan out can be replicating or multiplexing. In case of
replicating flow, each event is sent to all three channels. For the
multiplexing case, an event is delivered to a subset of available channels when
an event’s attribute matches a preconfigured value. For example, if an event
attribute called “txnType” is set to “customer”, then it should go to channel1
and channel3, if it’s “vendor” then it should go to channel2, otherwise
channel3. The mapping can be set in the agent’s configuration file.</p>

<h3>Defining the flow<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#defining-the-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To define the flow within a single agent, you need to link the sources and
sinks via a channel. You need to list the sources, sinks and channels for the
given agent, and then point the source and sink to a channel. A source instance
can specify multiple channels, but a sink instance can only specify one channel.
The format is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># list the sources, sinks and channels for the agent</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.sources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Source&gt;</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.sinks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Sink&gt;</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.channels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Channel1&gt; &lt;Channel2&gt;</span>

<span class="c"># set channel for source</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.sources.&lt;Source&gt;.channels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Channel1&gt; &lt;Channel2&gt; ...</span>

<span class="c"># set channel for sink</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.sinks.&lt;Sink&gt;.channel</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Channel1&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For example, an agent named agent_foo is reading data from an external avro client and sending
it to HDFS via a memory channel. The config file weblog.config could look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># list the sources, sinks and channels for the agent</span>
<span class="na">agent_foo.sources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">avro-appserver-src-1</span>
<span class="na">agent_foo.sinks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">hdfs-sink-1</span>
<span class="na">agent_foo.channels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">mem-channel-1</span>

<span class="c"># set channel for source</span>
<span class="na">agent_foo.sources.avro-appserver-src-1.channels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">mem-channel-1</span>

<span class="c"># set channel for sink</span>
<span class="na">agent_foo.sinks.hdfs-sink-1.channel</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">mem-channel-1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will make the events flow from avro-AppSrv-source to hdfs-Cluster1-sink
through the memory channel mem-channel-1. When the agent is started with the
weblog.config as its config file, it will instantiate that flow.</p>

<h3>Configuring individual components<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After defining the flow, you need to set properties of each source, sink and
channel. This is done in the same hierarchical namespace fashion where you set
the component type and other values for the properties specific to each
component:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># properties for sources</span>

</div>
<p>The property “type” needs to be set for each component for Flume to understand
what kind of object it needs to be. Each source, sink and channel type has its
own set of properties required for it to function as intended. All those need
to be set as needed. In the previous example, we have a flow from
avro-AppSrv-source to hdfs-Cluster1-sink through the memory channel
mem-channel-1. Here’s an example that shows configuration of each of those
components:</p>

<h3>Adding multiple flows in an agent<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#adding-multiple-flows-in-an-agent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A single Flume agent can contain several independent flows. You can list
multiple sources, sinks and channels in a config. These components can be
linked to form multiple flows:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># list the sources, sinks and channels for the agent</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.sources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Source1&gt; &lt;Source2&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you can link the sources and sinks to their corresponding channels (for
sources) of channel (for sinks) to setup two different flows. For example, if
you need to setup two flows in an agent, one going from an external avro client
to external HDFS and another from output of a tail to avro sink, then here’s a
config to do that:</p>

<div class="section" id="fan-out-flow">
<h3>Fan out flow<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#fan-out-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As discussed in previous section, Flume supports fanning out the flow from one
source to multiple channels. There are two modes of fan out, replicating and
multiplexing. In the replicating flow, the event is sent to all the configured
channels. In case of multiplexing, the event is sent to only a subset of
qualifying channels. To fan out the flow, one needs to specify a list of
channels for a source and the policy for the fanning it out. This is done by
adding a channel “selector” that can be replicating or multiplexing. Then
further specify the selection rules if it’s a multiplexer. If you don’t specify
a selector, then by default it’s replicating:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># List the sources, sinks and channels for the agent</span>
<span class="na">&lt;Agent&gt;.sources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&lt;Source1&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The multiplexing select has a further set of properties to bifurcate the flow.
This requires specifying a mapping of an event attribute to a set for channel.
The selector checks for each configured attribute in the event header. If it
matches the specified value, then that event is sent to all the channels mapped
to that value. If there’s no match, then the event is sent to set of channels
configured as default:</p>

</div>
<p>The mapping allows overlapping the channels for each value.</p>
<p>The following example has a single flow that multiplexed to two paths. The
agent named agent_foo has a single avro source and two channels linked to two sinks:</p>

</div>
<p>The selector checks for a header called “State”. If the value is “CA” then its
sent to mem-channel-1, if its “AZ” then it goes to file-channel-2 or if its
“NY” then both. If the “State” header is not set or doesn’t match any of the
three, then it goes to mem-channel-1 which is designated as ‘default’.</p>
<p>The selector also supports optional channels. To specify optional channels for
a header, the config parameter ‘optional’ is used in the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># channel selector configuration</span>
<span class="na">agent_foo.sources.avro-AppSrv-source1.selector.type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">multiplexing</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The selector will attempt to write to the required channels first and will fail
the transaction if even one of these channels fails to consume the events. The
transaction is reattempted on <strong>all</strong> of the channels. Once all required
channels have consumed the events, then the selector will attempt to write to
the optional channels. A failure by any of the optional channels to consume the
event is simply ignored and not retried.</p>
<p>If there is an overlap between the optional channels and required channels for a
specific header, the channel is considered to be required, and a failure in the
channel will cause the entire set of required channels to be retried. For
instance, in the above example, for the header “CA” mem-channel-1 is considered
to be a required channel even though it is marked both as required and optional,
and a failure to write to this channel will cause that
event to be retried on <strong>all</strong> channels configured for the selector.</p>
<p>Note that if a header does not have any required channels, then the event will
be written to the default channels and will be attempted to be written to the
optional channels for that header. Specifying optional channels will still cause
the event to be written to the default channels, if no required channels are
specified. If no channels are designated as default and there are no required,
the selector will attempt to write the events to the optional channels. Any
failures are simply ignored in that case.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">The problem with ExecSource and other asynchronous sources is that the
source can not guarantee that if there is a failure to put the event
into the Channel the client knows about it. In such cases, the data will
be lost. As a for instance, one of the most commonly requested features
is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tail</span> <span class="pre">-F</span> <span class="pre">[file]</span></tt>-like use case where an application writes
to a log file on disk and Flume tails the file, sending each line as an
event. While this is possible, there’s an obvious problem; what happens
if the channel fills up and Flume can’t send an event? Flume has no way
of indicating to the application writing the log file that it needs to
retain the log or that the event hasn’t been sent, for some reason. If
this doesn’t make sense, you need only know this: Your application can
never guarantee data has been received when using a unidirectional
asynchronous interface such as ExecSource! As an extension of this
warning - and to be completely clear - there is absolutely zero guarantee
of event delivery when using this source. For stronger reliability
guarantees, consider the Spooling Directory Source or direct integration
with Flume via the SDK.</p>

<h4>Spooling Directory Source<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#spooling-directory-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This source lets you ingest data by placing files to be ingested into a
“spooling” directory on disk.
This source will watch the specified directory for new files, and will parse
events out of new files as they appear.
The event parsing logic is pluggable.
After a given file has been fully read
into the channel, it is renamed to indicate completion (or optionally deleted).</p>
<p>Unlike the Exec source, this source is reliable and will not miss data, even if
Flume is restarted or killed. In exchange for this reliability, only immutable,
uniquely-named files must be dropped into the spooling directory. Flume tries
to detect these problem conditions and will fail loudly if they are violated:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If a file is written to after being placed into the spooling directory,
Flume will print an error to its log file and stop processing.</li>
<li>If a file name is reused at a later time, Flume will print an error to its
log file and stop processing.</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid the above issues, it may be useful to add a unique identifier
(such as a timestamp) to log file names when they are moved into the spooling
directory.</p>
<p>Despite the reliability guarantees of this source, there are still
cases in which events may be duplicated if certain downstream failures occur.
This is consistent with the guarantees offered by other Flume components.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The Kafka Source overrides two Kafka consumer parameters:
auto.commit.enable is set to “false” by the source and we commit every batch. For improved performance
this can be set to “true”, however, this can lead to loss of data
consumer.timeout.ms is set to 10ms, so when we check Kafka for new data we wait at most 10ms for the data to arrive
setting this to a higher value can reduce CPU utilization (we’ll poll Kafka in less of a tight loop), but also means
higher latency in writing batches to channel (since we’ll wait longer for data to arrive).</p>

the file channel. If the handler throws an exception, this source will
return a HTTP status of 400. If the channel is full, or the source is unable to
append events to the channel, the source will return a HTTP 503 - Temporarily
unavailable status.</p>
<p>All events sent in one post request are considered to be one batch and
inserted into the channel in one transaction.</p>

<p>A handler is provided out of the box which can handle events represented in
JSON format, and supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 character sets. The handler
accepts an array of events (even if there is only one event, the event has to be
sent in an array) and converts them to a Flume event based on the
encoding specified in the request. If no encoding is specified, UTF-8 is assumed.
The JSON handler supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
Events are represented as follows.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[{</span>

<p>One way to create an event in the format expected by this handler is to
use JSONEvent provided in the Flume SDK and use Google Gson to create the JSON
string using the Gson#fromJson(Object, Type)
method. The type token to pass as the 2nd argument of this method
for list of events can be created by:</p>

<h4>Legacy Sources<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#legacy-sources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The legacy sources allow a Flume 1.x agent to receive events from Flume 0.9.4
agents. It accepts events in the Flume 0.9.4 format, converts them to the Flume
1.0 format, and stores them in the connected channel. The 0.9.4 event
properties like timestamp, pri, host, nanos, etc get converted to 1.x event
header attributes. The legacy source supports both Avro and Thrift RPC
connections. To use this bridge between two Flume versions, you need to start a
Flume 1.x agent with the avroLegacy or thriftLegacy source. The 0.9.4 agent
should have the agent Sink pointing to the host/port of the 1.x agent.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

supported by the legacy source. The only supported 0.9.x mode is the
best effort, though the reliability setting of the 1.x flow will be
applicable to the events once they are saved into the Flume 1.x
channel by the legacy source.</p>

<h4>HDFS Sink<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#hdfs-sink" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This sink writes events into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It
currently supports creating text and sequence files. It supports compression in
both file types. The files can be rolled (close current file and create a new
one) periodically based on the elapsed time or size of data or number of events.
It also buckets/partitions data by attributes like timestamp or machine
where the event originated. The HDFS directory path may contain formatting
escape sequences that will replaced by the HDFS sink to generate a
directory/file name to store the events. Using this sink requires hadoop to be
installed so that Flume can use the Hadoop jars to communicate with the HDFS
cluster. Note that a version of Hadoop that supports the sync() call is
required.</p>

<p>This sink streams events containing delimited text or JSON data directly into a Hive table or partition.
Events are written using Hive transactions. As soon as a set of events are committed to Hive, they become
immediately visible to Hive queries. Partitions to which flume will stream to can either be pre-created
or, optionally, Flume can create them if they are missing. Fields from incoming event data are mapped to
corresponding columns in the Hive table. <strong>This sink is provided as a preview feature and not recommended
for use in production.</strong></p>

<p>Following serializers are provided for Hive sink:</p>
<p><strong>JSON</strong>: Handles UTF8 encoded Json (strict syntax) events and requires no configration. Object names
in the JSON are mapped directly to columns with the same name in the Hive table.
Internally uses org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe but is independent of the Serde of the Hive table.
This serializer requires HCatalog to be installed.</p>
<p><strong>DELIMITED</strong>: Handles simple delimited textual events.
Internally uses LazySimpleSerde but is independent of the Serde of the Hive table.</p>

<h4>Thrift Sink<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#thrift-sink" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This sink forms one half of Flume’s tiered collection support. Flume events
sent to this sink are turned into Thrift events and sent to the configured
hostname / port pair. The events are taken from the configured Channel in
batches of the configured batch size.</p>
<p>Thrift sink can be configured to start in secure mode by enabling kerberos authentication.
To communicate with a Thrift source started in secure mode, the Thrift sink should also
operate in secure mode. client-principal and client-keytab are the properties used by the
Thrift sink to authenticate to the kerberos KDC. The server-principal represents the
principal of the Thrift source this sink is configured to connect to in secure mode.

<p>This sink writes data to HBase. The Hbase configuration is picked up from the first
hbase-site.xml encountered in the classpath. A class implementing HbaseEventSerializer
which is specified by the configuration is used to convert the events into
HBase puts and/or increments. These puts and increments are then written
to HBase. This sink provides the same consistency guarantees as HBase,
which is currently row-wise atomicity. In the event of Hbase failing to
write certain events, the sink will replay all events in that transaction.</p>
<p>The HBaseSink supports writing data to secure HBase. To write to secure HBase, the user
the agent is running as must have write permissions to the table the sink is configured
to write to. The principal and keytab to use to authenticate against the KDC can be specified
in the configuration. The hbase-site.xml in the Flume agent’s classpath
must have authentication set to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kerberos</span></tt> (For details on how to do this, please refer to
HBase documentation).</p>
<p>For convenience, two serializers are provided with Flume. The
SimpleHbaseEventSerializer (org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.SimpleHbaseEventSerializer)
writes the event body
as-is to HBase, and optionally increments a column in Hbase. This is primarily
an example implementation. The RegexHbaseEventSerializer
(org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.RegexHbaseEventSerializer) breaks the event body
based on the given regex and writes each part into different columns.</p>

<h4>MorphlineSolrSink<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#morphlinesolrsink" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This sink extracts data from Flume events, transforms it, and loads it in near-real-time into Apache Solr servers, which in turn serve queries to end users or search applications.</p>
<p>This sink is well suited for use cases that stream raw data into HDFS (via the HdfsSink) and simultaneously extract, transform and load the same data into Solr (via MorphlineSolrSink). In particular, this sink can process arbitrary heterogeneous raw data from disparate data sources and turn it into a data model that is useful to Search applications.</p>
<p>The ETL functionality is customizable using a <a class="reference external" href="http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/current/cdk-morphlines/index.html">morphline configuration file</a> that defines a chain of transformation commands that pipe event records from one command to another.</p>
<p>Morphlines can be seen as an evolution of Unix pipelines where the data model is generalized to work with streams of generic records, including arbitrary binary payloads. A morphline command is a bit like a Flume Interceptor. Morphlines can be embedded into Hadoop components such as Flume.</p>
<p>Commands to parse and transform a set of standard data formats such as log files, Avro, CSV, Text, HTML, XML, PDF, Word, Excel, etc. are provided out of the box, and additional custom commands and parsers for additional data formats can be added as morphline plugins. Any kind of data format can be indexed and any Solr documents for any kind of Solr schema can be generated, and any custom ETL logic can be registered and executed.</p>
<p>Morphlines manipulate continuous streams of records. The data model can be described as follows: A record is a set of named fields where each field has an ordered list of one or more values. A value can be any Java Object. That is, a record is essentially a hash table where each hash table entry contains a String key and a list of Java Objects as values. (The implementation uses Guava’s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ArrayListMultimap</span></tt>, which is a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ListMultimap</span></tt>). Note that a field can have multiple values and any two records need not use common field names.</p>
<p>This sink fills the body of the Flume event into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_attachment_body</span></tt> field of the morphline record, as well as copies the headers of the Flume event into record fields of the same name. The commands can then act on this data.</p>
<p>Routing to a SolrCloud cluster is supported to improve scalability. Indexing load can be spread across a large number of MorphlineSolrSinks for improved scalability. Indexing load can be replicated across multiple MorphlineSolrSinks for high availability, for example using Flume features such as Load balancing Sink Processor. MorphlineInterceptor can also help to implement dynamic routing to multiple Solr collections (e.g. for multi-tenancy).</p>
<p>The morphline and solr jars required for your environment must be placed in the lib directory of the Apache Flume installation.</p>

<h4>ElasticSearchSink<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#elasticsearchsink" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This sink writes data to an elasticsearch cluster. By default, events will be written so that the <a class="reference external" href="http://kibana.org/">Kibana</a> graphical interface
can display them - just as if <a class="reference external" href="https://logstash.net/">logstash</a> wrote them.</p>
<p>The elasticsearch and lucene-core jars required for your environment must be placed in the lib directory of the Apache Flume installation.
Elasticsearch requires that the major version of the client JAR match that of the server and that both are running the same minor version
of the JVM. SerializationExceptions will appear if this is incorrect. To
select the required version first determine the version of elasticsearch and the JVM version the target cluster is running. Then select an elasticsearch client
library which matches the major version. A 0.19.x client can talk to a 0.19.x cluster; 0.20.x can talk to 0.20.x and 0.90.x can talk to 0.90.x. Once the
elasticsearch version has been determined then read the pom.xml file to determine the correct lucene-core JAR version to use. The Flume agent
which is running the ElasticSearchSink should also match the JVM the target cluster is running down to the minor version.</p>
<p>Events will be written to a new index every day. The name will be &lt;indexName&gt;-yyyy-MM-dd where &lt;indexName&gt; is the indexName parameter. The sink
will start writing to a new index at midnight UTC.</p>
<p>Events are serialized for elasticsearch by the ElasticSearchLogStashEventSerializer by default. This behaviour can be
overridden with the serializer parameter. This parameter accepts implementations of org.apache.flume.sink.elasticsearch.ElasticSearchEventSerializer
or org.apache.flume.sink.elasticsearch.ElasticSearchIndexRequestBuilderFactory. Implementing ElasticSearchEventSerializer is deprecated in favour of
the more powerful ElasticSearchIndexRequestBuilderFactory.</p>

Caution should be used in using this feature as the event submitter now has control of the indexName and indexType.

<h4>Kite Dataset Sink<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#kite-dataset-sink" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Experimental sink that writes events to a <a class="reference external" href="http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/guide/">Kite Dataset</a>.
This sink will deserialize the body of each incoming event and store the
resulting record in a Kite Dataset. It determines target Dataset by loading a
dataset by URI.</p>
<p>The only supported serialization is avro, and the record schema must be passed
in the event headers, using either <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flume.avro.schema.literal</span></tt> with the JSON
schema representation or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flume.avro.schema.url</span></tt> with a URL where the schema
may be found (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hdfs:/...</span></tt> URIs are supported). This is compatible with the

deserializer using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deserializer.schemaType</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">LITERAL</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Note 1: The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flume.avro.schema.hash</span></tt> header is <strong>not supported</strong>.
Note 2: In some cases, file rolling may occur slightly after the roll interval
has been exceeded. However, this delay will not exceed 5 seconds. In most
cases, the delay is neglegible.</p>

<p class="last">By default the File Channel uses paths for checkpoint and data
directories that are within the user home as specified above.
As a result if you have more than one File Channel instances
active within the agent, only one will be able to lock the
directories and cause the other channel initialization to fail.
It is therefore necessary that you provide explicit paths to
all the configured channels, preferably on different disks.
Furthermore, as file channel will sync to disk after every commit,
coupling it with a sink/source that batches events together may
be necessary to provide good performance where multiple disks are
not available for checkpoint and data directories.</p>

<h4>Spillable Memory Channel<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#spillable-memory-channel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The events are stored in an in-memory queue and on disk. The in-memory queue serves as the primary store and the disk as overflow.
The disk store is managed using an embedded File channel. When the in-memory queue is full, additional incoming events are stored in
the file channel. This channel is ideal for flows that need high throughput of memory channel during normal operation, but at the
same time need the larger capacity of the file channel for better tolerance of intermittent sink side outages or drop in drain rates.
The throughput will reduce approximately to file channel speeds during such abnormal situations. In case of an agent crash or restart,
only the events stored on disk are recovered when the agent comes online. <strong>This channel is currently experimental and
not recommended for use in production.</strong></p>

<h4>Failover Sink Processor<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#failover-sink-processor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Failover Sink Processor maintains a prioritized list of sinks, guaranteeing
that so long as one is available events will be processed (delivered).</p>
<p>The failover mechanism works by relegating failed sinks to a pool where
they are assigned a cool down period, increasing with sequential failures
before they are retried. Once a sink successfully sends an event, it is
restored to the live pool. The Sinks have a priority associated with them,
larger the number, higher the priority. If a Sink fails while sending a Event
the next Sink with highest priority shall be tried next for sending Events.
For example, a sink with priority 100 is activated before the Sink with priority
80. If no priority is specified, thr priority is determined based on the order in which
the Sinks are specified in configuration.</p>
<p>To configure, set a sink groups processor to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">failover</span></tt> and set
priorities for all individual sinks. All specified priorities must
be unique. Furthermore, upper limit to failover time can be set
(in milliseconds) using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">maxpenalty</span></tt> property.</p>

<h4>Load balancing Sink Processor<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#load-balancing-sink-processor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Load balancing sink processor provides the ability to load-balance flow over
multiple sinks. It maintains an indexed list of active sinks on which the
load must be distributed. Implementation supports distributing load using
either via <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">round_robin</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random</span></tt> selection mechanisms.
The choice of selection mechanism defaults to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">round_robin</span></tt> type,
but can be overridden via configuration. Custom selection mechanisms are
supported via custom classes that inherits from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AbstractSinkSelector</span></tt>.</p>
<p>When invoked, this selector picks the next sink using its configured selection
mechanism and invokes it. For <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">round_robin</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random</span></tt> In case the selected sink
fails to deliver the event, the processor picks the next available sink via
its configured selection mechanism. This implementation does not blacklist
the failing sink and instead continues to optimistically attempt every
available sink. If all sinks invocations result in failure, the selector
propagates the failure to the sink runner.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">backoff</span></tt> is enabled, the sink processor will blacklist
sinks that fail, removing them for selection for a given timeout. When the
timeout ends, if the sink is still unresponsive timeout is increased
exponentially to avoid potentially getting stuck in long waits on unresponsive
sinks. With this disabled, in round-robin all the failed sinks load will be
passed to the next sink in line and thus not evenly balanced</p>

<h3>Flume Interceptors<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#flume-interceptors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flume has the capability to modify/drop events in-flight. This is done with the help of interceptors. Interceptors
are classes that implement <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org.apache.flume.interceptor.Interceptor</span></tt> interface. An interceptor can
modify or even drop events based on any criteria chosen by the developer of the interceptor. Flume supports
chaining of interceptors. This is made possible through by specifying the list of interceptor builder class names
in the configuration. Interceptors are specified as a whitespace separated list in the source configuration.
The order in which the interceptors are specified is the order in which they are invoked.
The list of events returned by one interceptor is passed to the next interceptor in the chain. Interceptors
can modify or drop events. If an interceptor needs to drop events, it just does not return that event in
the list that it returns. If it is to drop all events, then it simply returns an empty list. Interceptors
are named components, here is an example of how they are created through configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-properties"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="na">a1.sources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">r1</span>
<span class="na">a1.sinks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">k1</span>
<span class="na">a1.channels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">c1</span>
<span class="na">a1.sources.r1.interceptors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">i1 i2</span>
<span class="na">a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">org.apache.flume.interceptor.HostInterceptor$Builder</span>
<span class="na">a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.preserveExisting</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">false</span>
<span class="na">a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.hostHeader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">hostname</span>
<span class="na">a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i2.type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">org.apache.flume.interceptor.TimestampInterceptor$Builder</span>
<span class="na">a1.sinks.k1.filePrefix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">FlumeData.%{CollectorHost}.%Y-%m-%d</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the interceptor builders are passed to the type config parameter. The interceptors are themselves
configurable and can be passed configuration values just like they are passed to any other configurable component.
In the above example, events are passed to the HostInterceptor first and the events returned by the HostInterceptor
are then passed along to the TimestampInterceptor. You can specify either the fully qualified class name (FQCN)
or the alias <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">timestamp</span></tt>. If you have multiple collectors writing to the same HDFS path, then you could also use
the HostInterceptor.</p>

<h4>UUID Interceptor<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#uuid-interceptor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This interceptor sets a universally unique identifier on all events that are intercepted. An example UUID is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b5755073-77a9-43c1-8fad-b7a586fc1b97</span></tt>, which represents a 128-bit value.</p>
<p>Consider using UUIDInterceptor to automatically assign a UUID to an event if no application level unique key for the event is available. It can be important to assign UUIDs to events as soon as they enter the Flume network; that is, in the first Flume Source of the flow. This enables subsequent deduplication of events in the face of replication and redelivery in a Flume network that is designed for high availability and high performance. If an application level key is available, this is preferable over an auto-generated UUID because it enables subsequent updates and deletes of event in data stores using said well known application level key.</p>

<h4>Morphline Interceptor<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#morphline-interceptor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This interceptor filters the events through a <a class="reference external" href="http://cloudera.github.io/cdk/docs/current/cdk-morphlines/index.html">morphline configuration file</a> that defines a chain of transformation commands that pipe records from one command to another.
For example the morphline can ignore certain events or alter or insert certain event headers via regular expression based pattern matching, or it can auto-detect and set a MIME type via Apache Tika on events that are intercepted. For example, this kind of packet sniffing can be used for content based dynamic routing in a Flume topology.
MorphlineInterceptor can also help to implement dynamic routing to multiple Apache Solr collections (e.g. for multi-tenancy).</p>
<p>Currently, there is a restriction in that the morphline of an interceptor must not generate more than one output record for each input event. This interceptor is not intended for heavy duty ETL processing - if you need this consider moving ETL processing from the Flume Source to a Flume Sink, e.g. to a MorphlineSolrSink.</p>

<p>Flume periodically polls, every 30 seconds, for changes to the specified
config file. A Flume agent loads a new configuration from the config file if
either an existing file is polled for the first time, or if an existing
file’s modification date has changed since the last time it was polled.
Renaming or moving a file does not change its modification time. When a
Flume agent polls a non-existent file then one of two things happens: 1.
When the agent polls a non-existent config file for the first time, then the
agent behaves according to the flume.called.from.service property. If the
property is set, then the agent will continue polling (always at the same
period – every 30 seconds). If the property is not set, then the agent
immediately terminates. ...OR... 2. When the agent polls a non-existent
config file and this is not the first time the file is polled, then the
agent makes no config changes for this polling period. The agent continues
polling rather than terminating.</p>

<h2>Topology Design Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#topology-design-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flume is very flexible and allows a large range of possible deployment
scenarios. If you plan to use Flume in a large, production deployment, it is
prudent to spend some time thinking about how to express your problem in
terms of a Flume topology. This section covers a few considerations.</p>
<div class="section" id="is-flume-a-good-fit-for-your-problem">
<h3>Is Flume a good fit for your problem?<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#is-flume-a-good-fit-for-your-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you need to ingest textual log data into Hadoop/HDFS then Flume is the
right fit for your problem, full stop. For other use cases, here are some
guidelines:</p>
<p>Flume is designed to transport and ingest regularly-generated event data over
relatively stable, potentially complex topologies. The notion of “event data”
is very broadly defined. To Flume, an event is just a generic blob of bytes.
There are some limitations on how large an event can be - for instance, it
cannot be larger than what you can store in memory or on disk on a single machine -
but in practice, flume events can be everything from textual log entries to
image files. The key property of an event  is that they are generated in a
continuous, streaming fashion. If your data is not regularly generated
(i.e. you are trying to do a single bulk load of data into a Hadoop cluster)
then Flume will still work, but it is probably overkill for your situation.
Flume likes relatively stable topologies. Your topologies do not need to be
immutable, because Flume can deal with changes in topology without losing data
and can also tolerate periodic reconfiguration due to fail-over or
provisioning. It probably won’t work well if you plant to change topologies
every day, because reconfiguration takes some thought and overhead.</p>

<h3>Flow reliability in Flume<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#flow-reliability-in-flume" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The reliability of a Flume flow depends on several factors. By adjusting these
factors, you can achieve a wide array of reliability options with Flume.</p>
<p><strong>What type of channel you use.</strong> Flume has both durable channels (those which
will persist data to disk) and non durable channels (those which will lose
data if a machine fails). Durable channels use disk-based storage, and data
stored in such channels will persist across machine restarts or non
disk-related failures.</p>
<p><strong>Whether your channels are sufficiently provisioned for the workload.</strong> Channels
in Flume act as buffers at various hops. These buffers have a fixed capacity,
and once that capacity is full you will create back pressure on earlier points
in the flow. If this pressure propagates to the source of the flow, Flume will
become unavailable and may lose data.</p>
<p><strong>Whether you use redundant topologies.</strong> Flume let’s you replicate flows
across&nbsp;redundant&nbsp;topologies. This can provide a very easy source of fault
tolerance and one which is overcomes both disk or machine failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The best way to think about reliability in a Flume topology is to consider
various failure scenarios and their outcomes.</em> What happens if a disk fails?
What happens if a machine fails? What happens if your terminal sink
(e.g. HDFS) goes down for some time and you have back pressure? The space of
possible designs is huge, but the underlying questions you need to ask are
just a handful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flume-topology-design">
<h3>Flume topology design<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#flume-topology-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first step in designing a Flume topology is to enumerate all sources
and destinations (terminal sinks) for your data. These will define the edge
points of your topology. The next consideration is whether to introduce
intermediate aggregation tiers or event routing. If you are collecting data
form a large number of sources, it can be helpful to aggregate the data in
order to simplify ingestion at the terminal sink. An aggregation tier can
also smooth out burstiness from sources or unavailability at sinks, by
acting as a buffer. If you are routing data between different locations,
you may also want to split flows at various points: this creates
sub-topologies which may themselves include aggregation points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sizing-a-flume-deployment">
<h3>Sizing a Flume deployment<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#sizing-a-flume-deployment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you have an idea of what your topology will look like, the next question
is how much hardware and networking capacity is needed. This starts by
quantifying how much data you generate. That is not always
a simple task! Most data streams are bursty (for instance, due to diurnal
patterns) and potentially unpredictable. A good starting point is to think
about the maximum throughput you’ll have in each tier of the topology, both
in terms of&nbsp;<em>events per second</em> and&nbsp;<em>bytes per second</em>. Once you know the
required throughput of a given tier, you can calulate a lower bound on how many
nodes you require for that tier. To determine attainable throughput, it’s
best to experiment with Flume on your hardware, using synthetic or sampled
event data. In general, disk-based channels
should get 10’s of MB/s and memory based channels should get 100’s of MB/s or
more. Performance will vary widely, however depending on hardware and
operating environment.</p>
<p>Sizing aggregate throughput gives you a lower bound on the number of nodes
you will need to each tier. There are several reasons to have additional
nodes, such as increased redundancy and better ability to absorb bursts in load.</p>

<h3>Handling agent failures<a class="headerlink" href="http://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#handling-agent-failures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the Flume agent goes down, then the all the flows hosted on that agent are
aborted. Once the agent is restarted, then flow will resume. The flow using
file channel or other stable channel will resume processing events where it left
off. If the agent can’t be restarted on the same hardware, then there is an option to
migrate the database to another hardware and setup a new Flume agent that
can resume processing the events saved in the db. The database HA futures
can be leveraged to move the Flume agent to another host.</p>
